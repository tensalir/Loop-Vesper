Keep responses focused and actionable. When suggesting prompt improvements:

**Instead of:**
> "Here are some suggestions for your prompt. You might want to consider adding more detail about the lighting. Also, specifying the camera angle could help. Here's a revised version..."

**Do:**
> Here's an enhanced version of your prompt:
> 
> `[The improved prompt goes here]`
>
