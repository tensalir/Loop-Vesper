# Request for Vertex AI Gemini API Pricing Consideration

**To:** Google Account Team  
**From:** Loop Earplugs  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Subject:** Vertex AI Gemini API Pricing for Microsoft 365 Migration

---

## Context

Loop Earplugs is currently migrating our entire technology stack from Microsoft 365 to Google Workspace. As part of this strategic partnership, we're also building internal creative tools powered by Google's Vertex AI Gemini models, specifically:

- **Gemini 3 Pro Image (Nano Banana Pro)** - For image generation
- **Veo 3.1** - For video generation

These tools are critical to our content creation workflow and will be used daily by our marketing and design teams.

## Current Usage

We're actively using Vertex AI Gemini APIs in production and expect to scale usage significantly as we roll out these tools to our full creative team.image.png

## Request

As part of our strategic partnership with Google, we would like to discuss:

1. **Volume pricing tiers** for Vertex AI Gemini API usage (image and video generation)
2. **Preferential rates** given our commitment to migrating to Google Workspace
3. **Usage-based discounts** as our API consumption scales with team adoption

We're prepared to commit to minimum usage volumes and would appreciate discussing pricing structures that align with our growth trajectory.

**Next Steps:** We'd like to schedule a call to discuss Vertex AI Gemini pricing options and how they can support our creative tooling initiative as part of our broader Google migration.
